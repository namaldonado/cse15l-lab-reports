Act as a student. You will be given a lab report project. 
Complete the tasks but also write  a small description of what you did after every task.

Researching Commands
Consider the command find.

Online, find 4 interesting command-line options or alternate ways to use the command you chose. 
For example, the -name option for find.  
For each of those options, give 2 examples of using it on files and directories ./technical. 
Show each example as a code block that shows the command and its output, 
and write two sentences about what it's doing and why it's useful. 
That makes 8 total examples, all focused on a single command. 
There should be two examples each for four different command-line options. 
Many commands like these have pretty sophisticated behavior possible - it can take years to be exposed 
to and lean all of the possible tricks and inner workings. 
Along with each option/mode you show, cite your source for how you found out about it as a URL 
or a description of where you found it. 
To find information about the commands, a simple Web search like "find command-line options" will probably give decent results. 
There is also a built-in command on many systems called man  (short for "manual") that displays  
information about commands; you can use men grep, for example, to see a long listing of information about how grep works.
